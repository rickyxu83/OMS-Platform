# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- Create: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`
- Read: `gh issue view <number> --comments`
- List: use `gh issue list` with suitable state and label filters
- Comment: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- Labels: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`
- Close: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`. The `gh` CLI does this automatically inside the clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.**

GitHub shares one number space across issues and pull requests. Resolve an ambiguous number with `gh pr view <number>`, then fall back to `gh issue view <number>`.

## Skill conventions

- “Publish to the issue tracker” means create a GitHub issue.
- “Fetch the relevant ticket” means run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.
- Wayfinder maps and child tickets use GitHub issues, sub-issues and native issue dependencies where available.
